🔧 **Backend Engineering Update: Scalable Flask Project Architecture Deployed!**

Hello LinkedIn family! 🙌  

As part of my ongoing work on the **Employee Records Management System**, I’ve made a key advancement:  
I’ve modularized the application architecture using **Flask Blueprints** — a major step toward **professional, scalable backend design**.  

---

## 🔍 What Changed?

🧠 **Before**:  
All routes and logic were bundled in a monolithic structure — not ideal for long-term maintainability.

🚀 **Now**:  
The application is divided into **feature-specific modules**, each with its own isolated responsibility, powered by **Flask Blueprints**.

---

## 📁 Blueprint Structure:

Here’s how I’ve broken things down:

### 🔹 `auth.py` – Authentication & Security  
- 🔐 `login`, `logout`, `register`  
- 🔄 Password change/reset  
- 🔑 Two-Factor Authentication  
- 📧 Email verification & social login routes  
- 📜 Terms of service, privacy policy, contact, help  

### 🔹 `employee.py` – Employee Data Management  
- 🧾 View, add, edit, delete employees  
- 🔍 Search functionality  
- 🏢 Filter by department & status (active/inactive/terminated)  
- 👨‍💼 Filter by role (e.g., Admin, HR, Developer)  

### 🔹 `dashboard.py` – Analytics & Insights  
- 📊 Department-wise analytics  
- 📈 Gender ratio and active/inactive stats  
- 🛠 Settings, notifications & dashboard home

## ⚙️ Why It Matters (From a Backend Engineering POV):

✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without bloating the core app.  
✅ **Maintainability**: Each module is self-contained and easier to debug or upgrade.  
✅ **Readability**: Clean route definitions with meaningful docstrings and RESTful naming conventions.  
✅ **Extensibility**: Designed to plug in JWT-based auth, Celery for background tasks, and a frontend via API.
